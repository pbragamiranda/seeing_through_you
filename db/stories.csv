"¨A man was masturbating in the store I used to work at, it was only me and him there. I called the security of the mall. The man somehow convinced the security men that I didn't understand what was going on because my mother language is not German. I saw his penis, saw his face, saw the act. Harassment is universal. He got away with it, he simply left. The manager of the store arrived later, I told her and she said she was sorry, but I should start wearing looser clothes because Germany is not Brazil (where I'm from). She told me she reported it to my boss, but since she never said anything or called me, I'll never know. I quit after that.¨

Besides I already was harassed in the S Bahn for “coming back from the club in the middle of the night without my boyfriend”, I was called a “whore” in the bus by a drunk man for no apparent reason, a guy once started to scream at me in the train apparently because I didn’t talk to him. One night I was waiting for my bus and a man started to ask me to get inside his van over and over again even though I was avidly refusing. I believe he just left after a while because I had a distance from the car and probably he was afraid of someone passing by and seeing it.

"""On 09 May I met my friend at Tempelhofer Feld. We had a picnic. We met at around 3 pm. I drank wine. Too much wine. My last memory is around twilight time. The next thing I remember is being alone at a bus stop. I had hurt my hand (i don't remember how). I didn't have my phone. I didn't know where exactly I was. I was confused and didn't know how I would get home. I was waving down cars that came by, hoping they would be a taxi. Finally, a taxi stopped. He saw my hand and gave me a wipe to clean it. He seemed kind.
He brought me back to my door. I paid him and got out of the taxi. I went to my door and was rummaging around in my bag for the keys. The taxi driver drove back around. He said I should get back into the taxi until I found my keys. I was hesitant but he said it was ok. I got in and was still looking for them. He took me somewhere quite nearby. I was still rummaging. He got in the back. He fucked me and I didn't even stop him, I was so drunk. I didn't try to fight back or say no. When he was done he took me back to my flat.
I don't even know why I'm writing this. I want to forget and never think of it again. Have booked an STD test for the beginning of June. I haven't told anyone; I don't want to deal with the shame. I am ashamed that I didn't try to stop him, that I was so drunk.""",2021,Mariendorf

I should put the mask on because it was my obligation. I told her to keep her distance and to leave me alone and take care of herself.  She began the verbal abuse:“Kanaken are all the same”;  “They leave other places to come here and they don't behave”.  I asked her to shut up because I work, pay my taxes, and have the same rights as her to be there. I also added that she was being racist. She continue and threatened to hit me with her crutches. She was an elderly woman. I said that if he wanted to hit me then he would call the police. She mocked and told me to call because I was the wrong one. I went to take my trash in the basket when I came back, she resumed the aggression. I told her what I might be doing was Ordnungswidrigkeit (administrative offense), liable for a cash fine, but what she was doing was a crime. The old man who accompanied her didn't say a single word.

"¨4 years ago I was at a house party where I got so drunk and stoned, so I decided to go to the kitchen to have a bit of space and smoke a cigarette. A couple of minutes later a guy that I know (not friends, never really talked) joined me and asked me if I wanted some drugs. I told him I had never tried it before but he insisted on trying it, and honestly, I was just being irresponsible because I didn‘t know what the effects would be. He gave me 2 big lines without really telling me how it would make me feel. A couple of minutes later, I felt it right away and I just couldn‘t feel or move my body, but I was pretty much aware of what was happening. We sat on the kitchen counter and he kissed me without me being able to do anything about it. I didn‘t want it and I didn‘t like him. Minutes later, some people entered the kitchen, then he whispered to my ear right away “Don’t tell anyone. (Also, his girlfriend was at that party). Another guy was cooking in the kitchen but we were behind him so he could not see us. Apparently, he heard that we were kissing and he didn’t want to disturb me so he stepped out of the kitchen. (He is my only witness). When it was just the two of us again, he started to touch me and I could not do anything because I was more or less paralyzed. I remember he unzipped or played with the zip of my jeans and tried to touch me even more. I felt so sick at that point I just wanted to throw up, all of a sudden I got this strength from God knows where to push his hands away and run to the toilet to throw up. By the time I was done there, he had already gone home. I feel like he knew from the beginning that I would be his easy target, so it was all intentional. Was it all part of his plan? What would have happened if I didn’t feel sick and wanted to throw up? I have no clue. Anyway, we bumped into each other a couple of times after and he seems to think that I don‘t remember about it. However, it triggers me a lot whenever I see his face. I had to leave several events abruptly just because he was there all of a sudden. I told some people around him about this and all they do is normalize his behavior. Then apparently when people asked him about this, he told them that it’s a lie and I’m just making things up.

At the time I was really sick and I dropped out of this school. I improved the health of my body and also of the mind and entered another massage therapy school. The same thing. They can't seem to bear to see a Latina at the same level as them. In this school, I didn't allow bullying. They were sometimes very ridiculous comments like if I'm wearing too many clothes, it's because I'm shy and because Brazilians are religious. If I wasn't wearing fewer clothes, it's because Brazilians are promiscuous. I always gave an answer. It was not pleasant, I wasn't relieved.

"¨I have been a German teacher for 27 years. I worked for more than 10 years in a largely German school in Berlin and suffered all kinds of prejudice for being a woman, a foreigner (despite being a German national), and a German teacher in Germany with full command of the language. I was criticized for not speaking German well. The absurdity was so big that even some typos in my Master's work were themed by one of the bosses at the time.
I suffered sexism and prejudice on the part of the two bosses, by the school secretariats, In the school secretariat. They even said that I was an actress in a pornographic film.
I was fired under humiliation in front of a class of over 12 students on the first day of school. I sued the school, won the case and a year later I was readmitted. I accepted at the time because I was almost without work for a year. Other than that, I got involved in different fights and discussions with the school, as several students also suffered some kind of discrimination. I always heard it wasn't my business. 
I've been teaching at a university for a little over a month and in the second week of class I was literally bullied by a mate who entered the classroom talking horrors for being in her room, which was not true. This time my reaction was to laugh out loud at her and make her somehow irritated. I wrote a letter of complaint to management and there was an informal verbal apology which I declined. Anyway, whether they like it or not, I'm going to continue teaching German wherever I want!¨
